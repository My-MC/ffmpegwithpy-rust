# About

## In Development

This library was developed for the purpose of improving [My-MC](https://github.com/My-MC)'s Python programming skills. However, in developing this library, I have been working on the Rust implementation because I think it will help me further improve my skills by developing it in multiple languages and making it faster. I am still a novice and the code may not be optimal, but I would be very happy if you could give me a warm look or send me some PR.

## Inspired Libraries

### <a href="https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl" target="_blank">youtube-dl</a>

This library allows you to download videos from YouTube and other sites.

Among them, this library allows you to specify download options in a dictionary type. This has the advantage of making the settings easier to understand.

I have incorporated this library's ability to specify options in dictionary form.

### <a href="https://github.com/VOICEVOX/voicevox_core" target="_blank">VOICEVOX CORE</a>

This library is the speech synthesis core of the free, medium-quality text-to-speech software **VOICEVOX**.

The core is implemented in Rust, with libraries for the Python API and C API.

This library is well organized in terms of testing, CI, etc., and we have incorporated it into our development process.

### <a href="https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi" target="_blank">FastAPI</a>

This library makes it easy to build WebAPIs with the same performance as Node.js and others.

The documentation for this library is. Like the documentation for this library, it is made using **mkdocs** and **material**.

This creates documents that are easy to read and understand.
